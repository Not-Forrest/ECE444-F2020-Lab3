SQL databases store data in tables that have fixed number of columns and variable number of rows.
Each row has an unique ID called a primary key. Each row can also store foreign keys, which are primary
keys for the role in another table. This allows multiple tables to be joined, and allows for updates in 1 
table to propagate to another.

NoSQL databases do not support the storage of foreign keys. Instead, repeating data will be duplicated 
instead of linked. This allows for faster querying. Most NoSQL databases do not support joins, 
so if joins are needed, the functionality must be implemented by whichever application that needs to join data.
